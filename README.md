# Saltconf21 testing strategies

Welcome to our salt states repository.

## Getting started

The setup script will configure a python virtualenv with salt installed.

Run `./setup` and wait until the script completes.

## Using the salt cli tools

Run `source vitualenv/bin/activate` to enable the virtualenv for you shell session.
You can then run `salt-call` which will use configuration and states in the local directory.
